						<p class="sectionP">
							Ever since I was young, I’ve been drawn to pretty things. It
							wasn’t until I was older that I started to understand that there
							was a human behind those designs. One of the reasons I was drawn
							to front-end development is because I could take those designs and
							turn them into functional “art”. I’ve been hooked ever since.
							Taking someone or my own design and bringing them to life is my
							favorite part of the process.
						</p>
						<p class="sectionP">
							I recently graduated with a Master’s in IT while working full
							time. I am now working on my skills to become an upstanding
							front-end engineer.
						</p>
						<p class="sectionP">
							When not working, I can be found making art, working on a video
							game with my brother (and playing other games!), and watching
							anime.
